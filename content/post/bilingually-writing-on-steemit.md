In @tumutanzi's new post [Use your native language to write on Steemit](https://steemit.com/cn/@tumutanzi/q9syu-steemit), 

@justyy commented that 800 words is more than enough to clear this easy problem. I know what the former meant, and I agree with the latter.  Let's re-write this post within 20 Words:


> Bilingually Writing on Steemit? If you can, do it. If not, don't.


I cannot, but I will.


When I began my Steemit, I saw many posts were written bilingually.  @jessicameng writes even  trilingually. I thought it might be a hidden rule on Steemit. Therefore I started writing in Chinese with an English translation. My English is not good, but I have been making progress in improving it. In the meanwhile, I found that bilingually writing is rather a hobby than a rule on Steemit. I am happy that I was mislead.


After reading some bilingual posts, I decided to read only those paragraphs written in Chinese in them. Although this post was written bilingually, I would suggest that you had better read the texts in Chinese if you can, which is much better than those in English. English is not my mother tongue, and my English is not good. However, it is better than machine's translation. I would be glad to exchange my thoughts with international friends on the topics of common interest.



I wish there were data showing the improvements which bilingual writing could make. Does it really attract more attention or even less? If more, is it worth it? Furthermore, we might even develop a new writing style in bilingual writing. If you read the paragraphs in Chinese, it is story A; if those in English, it is story B, although with the same pictures. It is worth a shot, isn't it?

@tumutanzi 新发了??篇帖子：[ Steemit中文用户有必要写中英文双语文章吗？](https://steemit.com/cn/@tumutanzi/q9syu-steemit)。 @justyy 评论说“这么浅显的道理你竟然碎碎练了一篇800字作文”。我明白前者的良苦用心，对后者的评论也很赞同。不如我们来做一道小学生作文题吧：


> 小学生作文题：请把这篇800字的帖子缩写到20字以内。


> 我的解答：


> 在 Steemit 双语写作？能写好就写，写不好别写。


然而，我觉得我就写不好，但是我还是要写。


我刚来 Steemit 的时候，看到 cn 区很多帖子都是双语写的， @jessicameng 甚至用三种语言来写，我误以为这是 Steemit 约定俗成的惯例呢。所以我自己的帖子尽量附上英文。写了几篇之后，我发现这样确实挺练习英文写作的。同时发现，原来这并不是惯例，只是个人爱好……感觉自己受骗了，但是被骗得很高兴。


阅读了 cn 区的一些双语帖之后，我就转为只挑中文段落读了。从学习角度来说，中国人的英文毕竟不如母语英文的人写得好。所以，本文虽然是双语写的，但尽量别读我的英文，不地道。关注我的人里有一位 @acrich，中英写作，说自己是加拿大人，中文说得很好，我说他是第二个大山，并且觉得从他这样的人写的双语帖子里应该会发现一些有趣有益的东西。从交流角度，中文之外有英文，当然对跨文化交流大大有利，不仅方便不懂中文的朋友了解帖子内容，而且可以让学中文的老外用作学习素材。


如果有统计数字就好了，比如比较一下双语写作与单语写作，收益是提高了还是降低了，提高的话高出多少，高出这部分值不值当。


如果玩得好，我希望能从 cn 区的双语写作里发展出一种新文体，那就是虽然配图相同，但中文是一个故事，而英文讲的是另一个，并且完美融合。


要不来试试？
