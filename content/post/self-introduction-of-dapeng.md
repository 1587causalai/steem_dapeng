Hi everyone! My name is Peng. My friends call me *dapeng* ([see the meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_(mythology))) as my nickname. Thus my Steemit ID is [@dapeng](https://steemit.com/@dapeng), which can be found in most of the figures in my posts like:

It is me and my wife. It is hard to find a nice picture with me alone in it after I got married.


## Story of Steemit and me


I joined Steemit in October 2016, following the introduction by @tumutanzi. Considering Steemit's starting time in March 2016, I was indeed an **early bird**. 


However, I am a **careless bird** as well. I lost my password soon after [my first post](https://steemit.com/life/@dapeng/how-to-rent-an-appartment-in-germany-and-austria) was posted. If you are aware of SRS (the Seven Rules of Steemit), you know what it means: DISASTER. DEPRESSION. DESPERATION. I tried ways to recover my password, but none of them worked. I became an **angry bird**. Temper did not work, though. The only cure was to forget about Steemit. 


Nine months later, @tumutanzi introduced Steemit to (not only) me again, and told me that he had made a lot of money out of his Steemit posts. In the meanwhile I had made not even a penny from my personal [blog](http://dapengde.com). I was not a **stupid bird**, was I?  I guessed @tumutanzi would intentionally or unintentionally bother me again in the future when he becomes a Steemit millionaire. Fortunately and amazingly, I found my lost Steemit password.  If you are aware of SRS, you know what it means: INTERESTING. INCREDIBLE. IMPOSSIBLE.  I thought it was a miracle and I was destined to come back to Steemit so as to shut @tumutanzi's mouth up.  


What a **lucky bird**!


## What I am blogging and not blogging


- I am a tourist who has been to many places on the Earth. I am  posting pictures taken in these places, such as in China, Germany, Korea, Italy, Czech, Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Slovenia and so on.

- I am currently living in Austria. I am writing the everyday life in Austria.

- I father two kids. I am writing their funny stories. My elder son plays the piano and I play the guitar more or less. I am sharing some videos of our music.

- I speak Chinese, English, and a little German. I am writing some inter-cultural topics. 

- I am an R user and package developer. I might write something about R language.

- I am a long-term blogger. I am re-posting some old posts from my blog with new updates, e.g. new pictures, new idears, with English translation. They were written in markdown syntax and it is easy to migrate. 

- Moreover, I am a scientific researcher in Micrometeorology, or more generally, Atmospheric Sciences, or Environmental Sciences, --- you don't have to know what it is. I won't mention it in my Steem blog. But in case you are interested, please visit [my personal website](http://pzhao.org).


Nice meeting you guys here!

大家好！我是大鹏，Steemit 账号就是 [@dapeng](https://steemit.com/@dapeng)。我的帖子里，插图大部分都有我的ID，本文的两幅插图就是例子。


## 我和 Steemit 


2016年十月，我响应  @tumutanzi 的号召而加入了 Steemit，算是来得早的，笨鸟先飞嘛。只是，我发布了 [第一篇帖子](https://steemit.com/life/@dapeng/how-to-rent-an-appartment-in-germany-and-austria)后，就把登录密码给忘了，确实是个笨鸟。如果你知道 Steemit 的七项条例，你就明白这是多大的灾难。密码丢了就找不回来了，唯一的解决办法，就是三十六???走为上。


九个月之后，@tumutanzi 又来了，这回他居然晒了他的钱包，说他从 Steemit 赚了大钱。与此同时，我的[博客](http://dapengde.com)一毛钱都没赚到。都一样是写博客，做人的差距咋就这么大呢？那我还是重回 Steemit 再试试吧。不然的话，将来等 @tumutanzi 成了亿万富翁的时候再来晒钱包，不管他是有意还是无意，我可能都会被刺激到。与此同时，我的 Steemit 密码竟然被我找回来了！我觉得这是冥冥之中自有天意。


## 我会写什么


- 游记。晒照片。介绍景点和旅游攻略。我去过中国很多地方，也去过德国，韩国，意大利，捷克，瑞士，法国，荷兰，匈牙利，斯洛文尼亚，列支敦士登等国家。

- 奥地利的日常生活。这是我目前生活的地方。

- 育儿。我家有俩娃，很多趣事值得记录。大娃弹钢琴，我会弹一点吉他，所以我会在这里贴一些我们的音乐视频。

- 跨文化交流。我说汉语，英语和德语，懂一点韩语。

- R 语言。我开发了几个R语言包，并且写了一本书，今年即将出版。

- 我博客上的旧帖子。当时写得草率，如今趁机重新整理加工，附上英文翻译，添加照片，在这里梅开二度。

- 我的正经工作是科研，专业是微气象学，或者往上一级算是大气科学，环境科学。专业领域的东西我一般不在这里写。但是如果碰巧你感兴趣，欢迎移步我的 [个人网站](http://pzhao.org).


谢谢！
