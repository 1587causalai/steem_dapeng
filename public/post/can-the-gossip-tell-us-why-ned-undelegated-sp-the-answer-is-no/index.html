<p>Data can prove something, as well as data can cheat some people. Gossip is fun, but one has to be seriously careful if one&rsquo;s gossip can ruin others&rsquo; reputation.</p>

<p>In one of @paulag&rsquo;s latest posts some data were displayed. Frankly speaking, I read some of @paulag&rsquo;s data analysis reports, which were impressive and useful. However, the post <a href="https://cnsteem.com/steemit/@paulag/can-the-data-tell-us-why-ned-undelegated-so-much-steem-power-steemit-business-intelligence#@dapeng/re-paulag-can-the-data-tell-us-why-ned-undelegated-so-much-steem-power-steemit-business-intelligence-20171027t093322442z">Can the Data Tell us Why Ned Undelegated so much Steem Power?</a> was rather disappointing. The hints or conclusions of this post were unreliable to my comment sense. As the author said that &lsquo;the data is correct&rsquo;, I decided to see if it is true.</p>

<p>The data displayed in this post were taken from Steemsql held by @arcange.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-in-paulag-s-post-was-incorrect">The Data in @paulag&rsquo;s Post Was Incorrect</h3>

<p>It is easy to find that the first table in @paulag&rsquo;s post disagrees with the chart. The maximum of @surpassinggoolge&rsquo;s votes (grey area) was 700 votes per day in the chart, while the average was 1327.4  votes per day. <strong>Apparently wrong. The average cannot be greater than the maximum.</strong></p>

<p>So, what is the truth?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s firstly see the time when @ned delegated and undelaged the SP.</p>

<p>If we ignore the fist day and the last day, each delegation lasted 76 days.</p>

<pre><code>
SELECT * FROM TxVotes WHERE voter IN ('htliao',  'linuslee0216', 'nicolemoker', 'surpassinggoogle', 'sweetsssj', 'tumutanzi',  'ramengirl') AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017/08/09' and '2017/10/24

</code></pre>

<p>In  @paulag&rsquo;s post, nicolemoker voted 3114 times in total. 3114 / 76. How could the average votes per day be 207.6?</p>

<p>I examined the data and got a new table:</p>

</table>

<p>The daily averages are around <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> of @paulag&rsquo;s calculations.</p>

<p>The numbers of votes are slightly different from @paulag&rsquo;s, perhaps because  @paulag&rsquo;s post took a different period of delegation, which was not mentioned in @paulag&rsquo;s post. This slight difference could be simply ignored.</p>

<p>Based on @paulag&rsquo;s <strong>incorrect calculation</strong>, all the subsequent numbers and conclusions were wrong, including the &lsquo;$457K&rsquo;, &lsquo;Voting over 1300 times a day, this does not surprise me&rsquo;,&lsquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>What still makes sense is the pie chart, some ratios and percentages, and the cluster diagram. <strong>However, I would double check them, as the post was carelessly written in  the first place.</strong></p>

<h3 id="facts-or-opinions">Facts or Opinions?</h3>

<p>It seems that @paulag&rsquo;s post was intended to give  some facts or data, but actually it was giving only some opinions based on wrong data and groundless assumptions.</p>

<p>In the section &lsquo;Transfer data&rsquo;, @paulag&rsquo;s post gave three conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 Reading the top memo on the table below, it very quickly because clear that @htliao was selling votes.</p>

<p>2 The data clearly shows @sweetsssj was also selling votes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt what &lsquo;selling&rsquo; means here. In my mind, if A sells somehing to B, it means that B pays A money and takes something away from A. But in @paulag&rsquo;s data, you can only see B paid A money. What did B take away from A? If nothing, was A selling? If I transfer some SBD to @paulag, can I immediately say that  @paulag is selling votes to me?</p>

<p>I am sure that <strong>the logic of @paulag&rsquo; post was broken</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 Within the memo for @htliao were also suggestions that @htliao may be leasing out some power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This conclusion was based on the transfer and delegation history between @htliao and @justyy. Many people have explained that justyy was just collecting some SP so as to support minnows. As a feedback and acknowledgement, justyy paid some so-called &lsquo;interests&rsquo; to the delegators. I delegated some. Besides @htliao and me, there have been some other delegators too, receiving interests from justyy everyday. It was not surprising that @paulag&rsquo;s post did not mention this, because <strong>the author knew nothing about the minnow support program.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As @paulag&rsquo;s post gave incorrect data, broken logic, and knew nothing about some facts, I think the post makes no sense to its title. Furthermore, it is badly misleading many readers, and ruining the reputations  of the innocents.</strong></p>

<p>&lsquo;I also decided to have a dig through the memos,&rsquo; said @paulag&rsquo;s post. I am looking forward to a further report, hopefully with no mistakes. This post of mine is only mentioning the mistakes in @paulag&rsquo;s post itself rather than my opinion to the author in person. I really like @paulag&rsquo;s previous reports, especially the nice charts in them. I wish @paulag could share the excel sheets so as to make the data analysis reproducible, repeatable, and reliable.</p>

<h3 id="voting-with-bots">Voting with bots?</h3>

<p>The wrong data in @paulag&rsquo;s post, especially the daily average votes, e.g. voting over 1300 times a day, mislead some people. They thought that these lucky guys  voted with bots.  Is voting with bots forbidden or a shame? I do not know. But let&rsquo;s see if they did it.</p>

<p>The figures below showed some 24-hour clocks, indicating the hours when they voted. The diameters of each sector showed the percentage of the quantity of their total votes.</p>

<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmUCXwNUtJz8GATLHEW4gyusoK4sQ2p8Tge6KzfDhhi6ui/unnamed-chunk-69-1.png" alt="unnamed-chunk-69-1.png" /></p>

<p>There were nearly no vote in some hours of htliao, linuslee0216, nicolemoker, ramengirl and tumutanzi&rsquo;s clocks (humans have to sleep), while surpassinggoogle&rsquo;s votes covered all 24 hours. If this is the reason why @ned is still delegating SP surpassinggoogle, then why did @ned undelegate from sweetsssj, whose voting hours showed  a similar pattern?</p>

<p><strong>Can the Data Tell us Why Ned Undelegated so much Steem Power? Apparently the answer is &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Data only show the facts (if the data is correct ), rather than the cause or intention. Only @ned himself can tell us the answer.</strong></p>

<h3 id="before-and-after-ned-s-delegation">Before and after @ned&rsquo;s Delegation</h3>

<p>What happend after @ned&rsquo;s delegation? See the comments (posts + replies) under cn category in the figure below. The vertical line indicates the date when @ned delegated SP.</p>

<p><img src="https://steemitimages.com/DQmamLMPh6nqbnyppRMqsCVcgXBPEpq43id8UwnW7DmYUYm/unnamed-chunk-70-1.png" alt="unnamed-chunk-70-1.png" /></p>

<p>Before ned&rsquo;s delegation, there were averagely 579 comments per day under cn category. After ned&rsquo;s delegation, there were averagely 1600 comments per day under cn category.</p>

<p>We will see what will happen after ned&rsquo;s undelegation. If ned&rsquo;s delegation was an experiment, I think his undelegation was the beginning of another.</p>

<p>PS. If you find any mistakes in my post, please let me know and you are highly appreciated.</p>
